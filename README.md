## Goal and LLM Agents
The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to build a chatbot for a restaurant that can can help customers with their orders and food ingredients.
The difference of this chatbot is it can speak with you.It receives voice (speech to text) and replies in a conversational way.

In this example , we are using Langchain Agents.The core idea of agents is to use an LLM to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code).

In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.

## Demo
