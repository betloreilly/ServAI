## Goal and LLM Agents
The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to build a chatbot for a restaurant that can can help customers with their orders and food ingredients. 
In this example , we are using Langchain Agents.The core idea of agents is to use an LLM to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code).
In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.
